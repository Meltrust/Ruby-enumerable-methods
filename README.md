# Home-made Ruby enumerable methods!!

> I wrote my own versions of some of the most iconic (and used) Ruby enumerable methods.

To prove that there's no magic to the original Ruby enumerable methods, I rebuilt #each, #each_with_index, #select, #all?, #any?, #none?, #count, #map and #inject.

## Built With
