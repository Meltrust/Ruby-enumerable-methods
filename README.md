# Home-made Ruby enumerable methods!!

> I wrote my own versions of some of the most iconic (and used) Ruby enumerable methods.  Implemented RSpec tests for all.

To prove that there's no magic to the original Ruby enumerable methods, I rebuilt #each, #each_with_index, #select, #all?, #any?, #none?, #count, #map and #inject.  Then I wrote RSpec tests for all.
